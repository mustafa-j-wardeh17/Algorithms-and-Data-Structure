# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains JavaScript implementations of various data structures and algorithms, including Binary Search Tree, Linked List, Stack, Queue, and basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Data Structures

### 1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Each node contains a key, and the keys in the left subtree are less than the node's key, while the keys in the right subtree are greater.

### 2. Linked List
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, called a node. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### 3. Stack
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can be added to and removed from the top of the stack.

### 4. Queue
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added to the rear and removed from the front.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

### a. Classes
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.

### b. Objects
Objects are instances of classes.

### c. Object Descriptors
Object descriptors provide a way to describe the properties of an object, including attributes like enumerable, configurable, and writable.

### d. Constructor Function
Constructor functions are special functions that create and initialize objects.

### e. Prototype
The prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties.
